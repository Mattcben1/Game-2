# 🌎 Theme Me — A Strategic Word Guessing Game

**Theme Me** is an interactive word-guessing game that challenges players to deduce a hidden word based on a daily **theme**.  
Each player gets limited guesses and numeric feedback that tells them *how close* they are to the secret word (0–100).  
Think *Wordle* meets *Categories* — but with a strategic, thematic twist.

## 🎮 How to Play

1. **You’re given a theme** (e.g., *Mountains*, *Oceans*, *Space*).
2. **Guess words** related to that theme.
3. After each guess, you'll get a **numeric score (0–100)** showing how close your word is.
4. You have **5 total guesses** to find the hidden word.
5. If you’re stuck, click the **Hint** button for a subtle clue.
6. If your word isn’t recognized, you’ll see a red “Not a listed word, try again” message — and it won’t count against your total guesses.
